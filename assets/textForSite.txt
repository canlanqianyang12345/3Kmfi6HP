Gillian Yue: Aspiring game designer/developer

Hey there! My name is Gillian, and I'm a Dartmouth 22' who will be majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Digital Arts. I spent the first fourteen years of my life in the beautiful city of Shanghai before going to Boston for high school. I've always wanted to build my own games since I was a child, so I've been working on independent game projects throughout high school. 

Here's a bit of info on the things that I know:

Coding-wise: 
	61	I learned Java in high school, created a simple Super-Mario style platform game with it, and could independently write useful programs with it; I also had experience with command based programming in Java as the software person for my high school's robotics team
	61	I work with Unity3d to create games, using C# to write the scripts of my games
	61	I've used HTML, CSS and Javascript in a Node.js web app project that virtually simulates my high school's bookstore. 
	61	I worked with Google AppsScript to process data in Google Sheets and Matlab to build models of a mountain in Utah for skiing routes
	61	I've written a Bash script for a photogrammetry software pipeline

(Digital) Art:
	61	I loved to doodle on paper since I was little; at 13 I purchased a drawing tablet and started doodling digitally
	61	I love pixel art a lot, possibly tied to the fact that my childhood best friend was Nintendo Game Boy Advance
	61	I worked with Maya and Blender to create 3d models for items sold in my high school's bookstore
	61	I did a one year research on the topic of photogrammetry and have worked with softwares that could scan multiple 2d photos of an item to render a 3d model
	61	My experience with Unity allowed me to have a basic understanding of terms such as sprites, textures, materials, lighting and shading, camera rendering, etc.

Music: 
	61	I enjoy all kinds of music, especially jazz
	61	I played the piano, guitar and harmonica
	61	I love coming up with tunes and melodies, and would compose short digital songs with Garageband; my goal is to be able to completely be in charge of composing music for my games
